# minuit1

- expFit.cpp: example using the more general fitting interface in minuit
- expFit.ipynb: equivalent example using lmfit
- SimultaneousExps(lm).ipynb: generation of histograms with correlated signals for simultaneous fit exercise
- rootExample.cpp: just another example of using ROOT classes in a C++ program
- *.root files: various input histograms for fitting exercises

Extracted Mean = 54.742 +/- 3.169
Extracted Sigma = 22.63 +/- 1.818
Chi^2 Value = 169.854
P Value = 1.454 * 10^-6
Reduced Chi^2  = 1.846

Though my P and reduced Chi^2 values appear to represent statistically significant data, my fits do not appear to appropriately highlight the signal. For this reason, though I may be interpreting this data incorrectly, I do not believe that I achieved a good fit for the data.
